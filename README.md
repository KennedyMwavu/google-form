# Mimick a Google form with Shiny

The website allows users to enter some info & stores it using persistent storage just like a google form would. 

Live app here: [Mimick-google-form](https://mwavu.shinyapps.io/google-form/)

Created this while I was learning shiny from [Dean Attali's blog](https://deanattali.com/2015/06/14/mimicking-google-form-shiny/). All credit goes to him.
